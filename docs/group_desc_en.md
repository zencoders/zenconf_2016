`Zencoders` is a group of software developers and informatics enthusiasts
cooperating to realize common projects or encourage the flow of ideas.  
The `Zencoders` group leverages knowledge sharing amongst its members to develop
innovating ideas.

Each group member could contribute to any project hosted in `Zencoders` open
repositories or start a new project.  
`Zencoders` do not adopt nor push towards a specific technology, but source
code of the projects will always be *open* and released with open licenses [GPL and
GPL-compatible, BSD, MIT, Apache, Mozilla, Eclipse, DTFYW].  
It follows that changes and contributions (they're welcome) may come from anyone
interested in the project, but each project has a limited number of maintainers,
belonging to `Zencoders`.
Anyone willing to contribute to a `Zencoders` project on a regular basis should ask
to join the group (that also means agreeing to its rules) by contacting directly the 
project maintainer, who will grant the required access permissions.

The `Zencoders` group is absolutely nonprofit, there is no registration fee and the very 
profits coming from the group membership are in terms of gain of experience and
visibility.
