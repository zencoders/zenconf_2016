`Zencoders` is a group of software developers and informatics enthusiasts 
leveraging knowledge sharing amongst its members to realize common projects 
and develop innovating ideas.

Each group member can contribute to any project hosted in `Zencoders` open
repositories or start a new project.  
`Zencoders` do not adopt nor push towards a specific technology, but source
code of the projects will always be *open* and released with open licenses [GPL and
GPL-compatible, BSD, MIT, Apache, Mozilla, Eclipse, DTFYW].  
It follows that changes and contributions (they're welcome) may come from anyone
interested in the project, but each project has a limited number of maintainers,
belonging to `Zencoders`.
Anyone willing to contribute to a `Zencoders` project on a regular basis should ask
to join the group and agree to its rules. The project maintainer has to be contacted 
in order to get the required access permissions to the repository.

The `Zencoders` group is absolutely nonprofit, there is no registration fee and the very 
profits coming from the group membership are in terms of gain of experience and
visibility.
